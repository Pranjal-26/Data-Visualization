# Exploring Datasets with *pandas* and Matplotlib<a id="0"></a>

Toolkits: The course heavily relies on [*pandas*](http://pandas.pydata.org/?utm_medium=Exinfluencer\&utm_source=Exinfluencer\&utm_content=000026UJ\&utm_term=10006555\&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkCoursesIBMDeveloperSkillsNetworkDV0101ENSkillsNetwork20297740-2021-01-01) and [**Numpy**](http://www.numpy.org/?utm_medium=Exinfluencer\&utm_source=Exinfluencer\&utm_content=000026UJ\&utm_term=10006555\&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkCoursesIBMDeveloperSkillsNetworkDV0101ENSkillsNetwork20297740-2021-01-01) for data wrangling, analysis, and visualization. The primary plotting library we will explore in the course is [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/?utm_medium=Exinfluencer\&utm_source=Exinfluencer\&utm_content=000026UJ\&utm_term=10006555\&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkCoursesIBMDeveloperSkillsNetworkDV0101ENSkillsNetwork20297740-2021-01-01).

Dataset: Immigration to Canada from 1980 to 2013 - [International migration flows to and from selected countries - The 2015 revision](http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/migration/data/empirical2/migrationflows.shtml?utm_medium=Exinfluencer\&utm_source=Exinfluencer\&utm_content=000026UJ\&utm_term=10006555\&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkCoursesIBMDeveloperSkillsNetworkDV0101ENSkillsNetwork20297740-2021-01-01) from United Nation's website

The dataset contains annual data on the flows of international migrants as recorded by the countries of destination. The data presents both inflows and outflows according to the place of birth, citizenship or place of previous / next residence both for foreigners and nationals. In this lab, we will focus on the Canadian Immigration data.

`Word` clouds (also known as text clouds or tag clouds) work in a simple way: the more a specific word appears in a source of textual data (such as a speech, blog post, or database), the bigger and bolder it appears in the word cloud.

Luckily, a Python package already exists in Python for generating `word` clouds. The package, called `word_cloud` was developed by **Andreas Mueller**. You can learn more about the package by following this [link](https://github.com/amueller/word_cloud/).
